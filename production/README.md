# Production
This directory is for code/schematics/layouts that will be implemented in the final prototype.

> **_NOTE:_** If you have code to test out a component/subsystem, it should probably go into ```/testing```

## Directory Structure:
```
.
|───autopasser-ecad    # contains any schematic/board development files
|
└───autopasser-src     # contains any embedded code or important scripts
```
